## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application follows a basic 3-layer architecture:

1. **Controller Layer**  
   Handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to the appropriate service methods.  
   ‚û§ _Exposes the RESTful endpoints._

2. **Service Layer**  
   Contains the business logic of the application.  
   ‚û§ _Processes requests, validates data, and orchestrates actions between layers._

3. **Repository Layer**  
   Responsible for interacting with the database using Spring Data JPA.  
   ‚û§ _Performs CRUD operations directly on the database._
